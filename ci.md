# GitHub Flow
1. Pull in the latest code. Create a branch from `master`. Start working.    

2. Create commits on your new branch. Build and test locally.  

  Pass? Go to the next step. Fail? Fix errors or tests and try again.  

3. Push to your remote repository or remote branch.  

4. Open a pull request. Discuss the changes, add more commits 

  as discussion continues. Make tests pass on the feature branch.
  5. Merge/rebase commits from master. Make tests pass on the merge result.  
6. Deploy from the feature branch with a sneaky bug to production.
  7. If everything is good in production for some period of time, merge changes to master.
