# GitHub Flow
> **GitHub flow** is sometimes used as a nickname to refer to a flavor of trunk-based development  
  when code is deployed straight from feature branches. This list is just an interpretation  
  that I use in my [DevOps courses](http://redpill.solutions).  
  The official tutorial is [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
  5. Merge/rebase commits from master. Make tests pass on the merge result.  
  6. Deploy from the feature branch with a sneaky bug to production.
  7. If everything is good in production for some period of time, merge changes to master.
